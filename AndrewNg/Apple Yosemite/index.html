					<h1>Redesigned interface.</h1>
					<h2>Completely new. Completely Mac.</h2>
					<p><span>With OS X Yosemite, we set out to elevate the experience of using a Mac. To do that, we looked at the entire system and refined it app by app. Feature by feature. Pixel by pixel. And we built great new capabilities into the interface that put need-to-know information at your fingertips. The result is that your Mac has a fresh new look, with all the power and simplicity you know and love. <a href="http://www.apple.com/osx/preview/design/">Learn more</a></span></p>
