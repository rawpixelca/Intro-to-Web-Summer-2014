# Project 1 : Build A Website For Your Own Restaurant Or Cafe

## Description

You're the owner of a new restaurant or cafe in Toronto and you need a website to showcase your business, as well as provide information to potential customers.

Be as creative as you like. You're free to grab content and images from other sites. The important thing is that your project is unique and your own.

## Project Details

**Your project must incorporate the following:**

#### Site Pages

- Site Navigation
	- Customers should be able to easily navigate your site from page to page without using the "back" button on their browser.

- Home Page
	- Be creative as you like. This page should entice customers to want to learn more about your business.

- About Page
