# Week 3 - Class 5 : Tables, Tabular Data And Media Queries

## In Class

We're going to look at how to create and use tables and tabular data. We'll also be learning about media queries which allow us to change CSS based on things like screen size, device-orientation or display-density. We can use media queries to make our web pages and websites more responsive which is a necessity when building for the wide variety of devices people use to view web content.
