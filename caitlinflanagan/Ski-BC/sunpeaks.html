				<h2>Sun Peaks</h2>
					<p>Sun Peaks Resort is an alpine ski resort located in Sun Peaks, British Columbia, Canada, 50 km northeast of Kamloops, British Columbia, Canada. The summit of the ski area is at an elevation of 2,080 m (6,824 ft), with an 881 m (2,891 ft) vertical rise from the base of the peak. Sun Peaks Resort has 15 square kilometres (3,678 acres) of skiable terrain, and receives an average of 5.6 m (220 in) of snow per year. The resort has 11 lifts with a total capacity of 11,000 riders per hour with the Burfield chair being the longest at 23 minutes total ride. There are 122 runs, including 12 gladed areas and 40 km of cross country trails. Sun Peaks area averages over 2000 hours of sun a year. The ski area comprises three mountains: Tod Mountain, Sundance Mountain, and Mt. Morrisey. Prior to July 1993, Sun Peaks was known simply as Tod Mountain, named after the highest ski mountain at the resort. The first chair lift, the Burfield chair, as well as the Burfield lodge, opened in 1961. In 1968, the lift was damaged by fire and was forced to close for repairs until December 1970. In 1992, Tod Mountain was purchased by Nippon Cable Company Ltd. of Tokyo. Also since 1992, Ecosign Mountain Resort Planners Ltd. has acted as prime consultant and project planners for the transformation of the Tod Mountain Ski Area into Sun Peaks Resort. As well as skiing, Sun Peaks also operates a downhill mountain bike park with over 2000 vertical feet of terrain. The Sunburst Express quad chair takes riders to a trails park up top, and then leaves the rider with over 29 trails to choose from. There is a hybrid of downhill and technical, mixing steeps with small drops and tight corners. Sun peaks joins the growing list of ski resorts that created bike runs in the summer. Sun peaks boasts a 6,400 yard, 18-hole golf course. It is also the highest elevation course in British Columbia at over 1,200 meters above sea level. In 2003 Sun Peaks opened "Tube Time" to allow for recreational tubing at the resort.</p>
